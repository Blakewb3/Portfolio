                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hello, I'm Blake Wallace. I am an aspiring, soon to be software developer. In December of 2023 I
                    will have
                    graduated from the University of Denver with a full stack developer certifaction, <br> and the
                    skills and
                    integrity to go along with it. Thank you for checking out my portfolio and I hope you enjoy it as
                    much as I enjoyed building it. </p>

                <p> Since I was young I always had a strong interest in seeing how things worked and how they were made.
                    I remember in my early years I would be more excited to take apart a moving <br> toy then to
                    actually
                    play with it just to see the moving parts. Later in my teenage years I started being very interested
                    in technology. It started by building my own computer and then I <br> had an amazing opportunity to
                    work for TTM technologies in my senior year of high school where I learned how to build circuit
                    boards. </p>

                <p>Apart from being interested in hardware, I found myself getting progressively more intrigued about
                    software and the overall user interface of the technology we all use everyday. I really enjoy <br>
                    that you can build something out of nothing, and be as creative as you want to be. I extremly look
                    forward to seeing where this adventure and carrer will take me, and cant wait to build somthing
                    <br>amazing thaty people can incorperate in the day to day lives.
                </p>
